This folder contains a set of template screen files that can be read by the
IDR ScreenReader.

Screen files allow to group files that can be read by
[Bio-Formats](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/) but where there is
no explicit High-Content Screening metadata and map them into the
[Screen Plate Well](http://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/5.5.7/developers/screen-plate-well.html) specification of the OME model.

The following examples are covered by the files in this directory:

-   [1row1column1field.screen](1row1column1field.screen): single plate with 1 
    well and 1 field

-   [2rows2columns1field.screen](2rows2columns1field.screen): single plate
    with 2 wells and 1 field each

-   [2rows2columns2fields.screen](2rows2columns2fields.screen): single plate
    with 2 wells and 2 fields each

-   [2rows2columns2fields.screen](2rows2columns2fields.screen): single plate
    with 2 wells and 2 fields each
