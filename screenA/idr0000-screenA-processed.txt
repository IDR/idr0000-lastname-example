E.g. if results are at the siRNA level include the siRNA Identifier	# include if necessary	# include if necessary	# example of a results column. For example a z-score at the individual reagent level	# example of a column for a score giving the average over several replicates of a reagent	# an example of the type of column you might want to include to show if the gene was selected for further validation	# enter 'yes' if the row has a phenotype	"# the level of entity the phenotypes are linked to e.g. well level, siRNA level, multiple replicates of an siRNA, gene level"	# example of a column for stating what phenotype was observed in cells treated with the reagent	# example of a column for stating that a second phenotype was also observed. Add as many phenotype columns as necessary.
